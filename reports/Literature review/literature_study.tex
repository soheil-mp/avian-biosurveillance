\section{Introduction}
This is a sample document to verify that the \LaTeX{} compiler is working correctly on your machine.

\section{Math Example}
As a test for mathematical rendering, here is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost function often used in regression:

\begin{equation}
    J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2
\end{equation}
